<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Logic Comparators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Collector</li><li>Totem-Pole</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Logic comparators can be categorized into two main output configurations: Open Collector and Totem-Pole. Open Collector outputs allow multiple devices to share a common line, pulling it low when active; they require external pull-up resistors for proper functionality. This configuration is suitable for wired-AND logic. In contrast, Totem-Pole outputs can drive high or low states actively, ensuring faster response and stronger current drive, making them ideal for driving loads without external components. Each type serves distinct applications and design requirements.</p></p>

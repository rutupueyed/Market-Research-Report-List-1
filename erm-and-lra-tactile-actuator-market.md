<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ERM and LRA Tactile Actuator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Eccentric Rotating Mass (ERM) Actuators</li><li>Linear Resonant Actuators (LRAS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ERM and LRA tactile actuator market is divided into two main types. Eccentric Rotating Mass (ERM) actuators generate vibrations by spinning an unbalanced mass attached to a motor, creating a strong tactile feedback experience, commonly used in smartphones and gaming controllers. Linear Resonant Actuators (LRAs), on the other hand, produce vibrations through oscillation of a mass within a spring, offering more precise and subtle feedback, making them ideal for applications requiring fine haptic sensations, such as wearables and smartphones.</p></p>

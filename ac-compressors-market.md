<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC Compressors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Displacement</li><li>Centrifugal Compressors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The AC compressors market consists primarily of two types: positive displacement and centrifugal compressors. Positive displacement compressors function by trapping a fixed amount of refrigerant and reducing its volume, thus increasing pressure, making them ideal for small or medium applications. On the other hand, centrifugal compressors utilize high-speed rotating impellers to impart kinetic energy to the refrigerant, suitable for large cooling systems due to their ability to move large volumes of gas efficiently. Each type serves distinct applications based on performance and capacity needs.</p></p>
